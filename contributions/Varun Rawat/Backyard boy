Dance with me in my backyard boy
Looking super fine in your corduroy
Drive me round the block
We can go in a loop
And we'll turn the volume up on some
Good boy band tunes
Love to feel the fresh air
I can feel your eyes stare
And I'm not gonna lie
I get a little bit scared
My heart is on wings
I'm living in dreams
And at the top of our lungs, we sing
